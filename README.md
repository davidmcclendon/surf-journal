# Surf journal and analytics
This is a fun little shiny app I spun up to track my surfing history.
Right now, it's just a fancy Google form with a map feature. I plan on adding cooler outputs and analytics in the future when I get more data. For now, just for tracking.

The app lives here: https://davidmc.shinyapps.io/surf-journal/

Some of the UI inspired by this post: https://deanattali.com/2015/06/14/mimicking-google-form-shiny/
